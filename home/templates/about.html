            <p>Mistral is a new wine bar and shop tucked away on Chester's historic Watergate Row North. Conceived by international wine writer and critic Paul Caputo and bespoke tailor Patrick Barker, Mistral houses a collection of authentic wines by small growers and boutique wineries that value sustainable winemaking and respect for the environment above all else.</p>
            <p>After years of talking about it, we've decided to make it a reality and create our own venue. We're now open!!! You can expect great wines from all over the world, simple plates and a cool, contemporary space to relax in. We hope you'll come and join us for a glass or two and tell us what you think.</p>
