Mistral is a new wine bar and shop tucked away on Chester's historic Watergate Row North. Conceived by international wine writer and critic Paul Caputo and bespoke tailor Patrick Barker, Mistral houses a collection of authentic wines by small growers and boutique wineries that value sustainable winemaking and respect for the environment above all else.


After years of talking about it, we've decided to make it a reality and create our own venue. We're now open!!! You can expect great wines from all over the world, simple plates and a cool, contemporary space to relax in. We hope you'll come and join us for a glass or two and tell us what you think.
